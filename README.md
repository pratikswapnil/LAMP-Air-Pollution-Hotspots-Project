# LAMP-Air-Pollution-Hotspots-Project 
This project focuses on the development of a local action plan to mitigate air pollution in two hotspots: Siri Fort, New Delhi, and Bahadurgarh, Haryana. The project was conducted as a collaborative effort between the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).

**My Role and Contributions:**

As a Project Associate, my primary responsibility was to contribute to the on-ground data collection, analysis, and report preparation for this project. My key contributions included:

**Emission Source Mapping:** I conducted extensive field surveys to identify and map major air pollution sources in both the Siri Fort and Bahadurgarh areas.

**Data Collection:** I was responsible for collecting high-resolution air quality data using a portable sensor, specifically the AQMesh, to pinpoint pollution hotspots.

**AERMOD Modeling:** I conducted air dispersion modeling using the AERMOD model to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed control options for air quality improvement.

**Data Analysis & Visualization:** I contributed to the analysis of the collected data and assisted in creating the maps and figures, including the spatial distribution of predicted pollutant concentrations, for the project reports.

**Report Drafting:** I was directly involved in the drafting and authoring of sections of the project's technical reports, documenting our findings and proposed action plans.

**Methodology**

The project employed a multi-pronged approach to assess and understand the local air quality landscape. Our methodology included:

**Ambient Air Quality Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring to measure baseline pollution levels.

**Field & Traffic Surveys:** On-site surveys were conducted to identify and quantify local emission sources like traffic, residential activities, and industries.

**Portable Sensor-based Monitoring:** The AQMesh sensor was used to provide high-resolution spatial and temporal data on air pollutants.

**Air Dispersion Modeling:** The AERMOD model was used to evaluate the efficacy of various control options for air pollution reduction.

**Key Findings**

The project successfully identified the major contributors to air pollution in each area, leading to the development of a targeted local action plan.

**Siri Fort Hotspot:** Key pollution sources identified included vehicular exhaust, road dust, construction and demolition activities, and waste burning.

**Bahadurgarh Hotspot:** The main contributors to air pollution were found to be industrial activities, vehicular traffic, and road dust.
